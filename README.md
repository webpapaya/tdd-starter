# TDD Starter (hamjest and mocha)

I mainly use this as a base for the http://codingdojo.org/kata/Employee-Report/ Kata. Under the hood it's using [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [hamjest](https://github.com/rluba/hamjest/wiki/Matcher-documentation)
```
npm i
npm run test -- --watch
# Start TDD =)
```
